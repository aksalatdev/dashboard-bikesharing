# Bike Sharing Dashboard ðŸš²

## Project Overview

This interactive dashboard analyzes bike sharing data to answer key business questions about usage patterns, seasonal trends, and weather impacts. The analysis focuses on:

1. Comparing bike usage between 2011 and 2012 to identify growth factors beyond seasonal weather
2. Analyzing how extreme weather affects casual vs. registered users differently

## Setup Environment - Anaconda
